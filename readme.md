# Data Collection Demonstration

A simple web-based demonstration of browser data collection techniques.

## What it does

This project shows how websites can collect various types of data from your browser including:

- Browser information and capabilities
- Screen resolution and device details
- Location data (with permission)
- Mouse movement and behavior tracking
- System performance metrics
- Available fonts and media devices
- WebGL and canvas fingerprinting

## Usage

1. Open `index.html` in your browser
2. Click "Collect" to gather all available data
3. View the collected information in the output area
4. Click "Clear" to reset everything

## Purpose

## Privacy Note

All data collection happens locally in your browser. Nothing is sent to any external servers.
